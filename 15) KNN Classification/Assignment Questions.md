**Build a KNN model for scikit learn Iris dataset.\
Take 75% of data for training, take 25% of data for testing.**

**Build and test the model for below scenarios:**\
**- Split the data with 50% for testing and 50% for training.**\
**- Build the model without randomizing and test the model accuracy.**\
**- Split the data with random_state=0 once and with random_state=42 another time.**\
**- Build model with 1, 3 and 5 neighbors and test the accuracy of model.**\
**- Build the model with only sepal length and sepal Width instead of using all 4 features. and test the accuracy of model.**\
**- Build the model with only sepal Length and Petal Length instead of using all 4 features. and test the accuracy of model.**

**Try above scenarios on cancer data set, which is also available in sklearn.datasets.**
